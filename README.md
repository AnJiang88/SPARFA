# Sparse Factor Analysis in Learning and Content Analytics (SPARFA)
Innovative statistical ML models and algorithms to uncover student underlying learning pattern from test responses. Designed to enhance personalized teaching strategies and curriculum management. 

Two advanced solutions are given: 
1. **SPARFA-M**, solves the SPARFA problem using maximum-likelihood based probit or logistic regression.
2. **SPARFA-B**, solves the SPARFA problem using a Bayesian method based on Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In contrast to SPARFA-M, which computes point estimates for each of the parameters of interest, SPARFA-B computes full posterior distributions for parameters of interest.
